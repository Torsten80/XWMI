Passive checks are to reduce the load for the monitoring server.
Single checks with wmiquery1.sh or wmiquery.sh sometimes take quite a long time.
The idea is similar to check_mk to perform only one check that returns various values.
Here system1.qry is executed with several basic wql queries. 

(SELECT Caption,Description,Size,FreeSpace  FROM Win32_LogicalDisk
Select Name,AllocatedBaseSize,CurrentUsage,PeakUsage from Win32_PageFileUsage
SELECT PercentIdleTime FROM Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_Processor WHERE Name="_Total"
Select SystemUptime from Win32_PerfFormattedData_PerfOS_System
Select  year, month ,day, hour, minute, second from Win32_UTCTime
select TotalVisibleMemorySize, FreePhysicalMemory, TotalVirtualMemorySize, FreeVirtualMemory from Win32_OperatingSystem
Select state From Win32_Service Where Name = "SENS")

You save some connections. 
For this only check_Xwmi_system3.sh is executed.

The path to nagios.cmd may have to be adjusted.
For example like this:
sed -i 's/\/var\/lib\/shinken\/nagios.cmd/\/var\/lib\/naemon\/naemon.cmd/g' check_Xwmi_*P.sh
